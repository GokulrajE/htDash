# htDash — CLAUDE.md

HOMER Therapy Dashboard (htDash) is a Flask-based clinical dashboard for managing the HOMER RCT therapy intervention.

---

## Project Overview

**htDash** manages stroke patients across three hospital sites (Manipal, Ranipet, Ludhiana). Core features:
- **Patient Management:** Enrollment, group assignment (experimental/control), status tracking
- **Exercise Management:** VCG programs, ADL session recording, call logs
- **Analytics:** Usage charts per hospital site
- **Device Management:** Pluto & Mars device assignment, actigraph watch tracking
- **Data Sync:** AWS S3 sync for device config data and call records
- **Access Control:** Role-based: global admin, therapist, engineer

**Stack:** Flask (Python) · Tailwind CSS · Vanilla JS · Chart.js · JSON/CSV file storage · AWS S3

## Documentation

| Document | Contents |
|---|---|
| `docs/data_schemas.md` | All data file schemas: patient JSON, protocol events, device files, logs |
| `docs/pages.md` | URL structure, page specs, all actions and modals defined in one place |

---

## Active Refactoring: SPA → URL-Routed Website

**Branch:** `urlrouted`

The original `main` branch is a single-page app (`dashboard.html`, 39KB). Being replaced with a URL-routed multi-page Flask app.

**Reason:** Flask blueprints already define natural URL boundaries; browser back/forward and deep-linking are broken in the SPA; no shared state justifies the complexity.

**Approach:**
- All work on `urlrouted` branch
- `main` remains functional throughout
- Merge only when complete and tested

## Implementation Order

1. ✅ Define URL structure and data flow
2. ✅ Create `base.html` — sidebar, header, navigation as real links
3. ✅ Dashboard page — summary stats + events panels
4. ✅ Patients list page
5. ✅ Patient detail page — overview, key dates, events panels
6. ⬜ Patient detail — protocol event completion modals (device setup first)
7. ⬜ Devices page
8. ⬜ SIMs page
9. ⬜ Cleanup — remove old `dashboard.html` and unused JS
10. ⬜ Test all routes and functionality
11. ⬜ Merge to `main`

## Key Files Reference

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `main.py` | App entry point, blueprint registration |
| `config.py` | Credentials, hospital map, AWS settings |
| `models/user.py` | Session proxy for per-request user context |
| `routes/auth.py` | Login, logout, on-login checks |
| `routes/dashboard.py` | Dashboard stats and events API |
| `routes/user_management.py` | Patient CRUD, group assignment, patient events API |
| `routes/devices.py` | Device page (stub) |
| `routes/sim_cards.py` | SIM cards page (stub) |
| `utils/data_access.py` | Patient file I/O, hospital folder lookup, session logs |
| `utils/protocol_events.py` | Protocol event file creation and date population |
| `config/study_protocol.json` | Static protocol event definitions |
| `templates/base.html` | Shared layout — sidebar, header, nav |
| `templates/patient_detail.html` | Patient detail page |
| `static/js/app/` | Per-page JS modules |

## Conventions & Constraints

- Do not modify the `main` branch during this refactor
- Keep all existing API endpoint URLs intact
- Preserve exact visual appearance (Tailwind classes, layout)
- Do not add new features during this refactor — functionality parity only
- All date fields stored as ISO 8601 datetime (`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM`); event-level comparisons use date only (call `.date()` before comparing)
- Status is never stored — always derived by `derive_status()` in `utils/data_access.py`

---

## What Stays as JS

- Patient detail sub-tabs (contextual UI within one page)
- Chart.js rendering
- Modal interactions
- In-page dynamic updates (fetch calls within a page)
